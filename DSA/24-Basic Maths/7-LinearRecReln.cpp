    Linear Reccurence Relations

**Solution Steps:**
   The solution is broken down into four steps:

   a. **Determine K, the number of terms on which f(i) depends:**
      - K is the minimum integer such that f(i) doesnâ€™t depend on f(i-M) for all M > K.
      - For the Fibonacci sequence, because the relation is f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2), therefore, K = 2.

   b. **Determine vector F1, the initial values:**
      - If each term of a recurrence relation depends on K previous terms, then it must have the first K terms defined, otherwise, the whole sequence is undefined. For Fibonacci sequence (K = 2), the well-known initial values are:
        - f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1
      - We define a column vector F1 as a K x 1 matrix whose first row is f(i), second row is f(i+1), and so on, until the Kth row is f(i+K-1). The initial values of f are given in column vector F1 that has values f(1) through f(K).

   c. **Determine T, the transformation matrix:**
      - This is the most important step in solving the recurrence relation. Construct a K x K matrix T, called the transformation matrix, such that:
        - T * F1 = F2
      - Here is how to construct it. Suppose that the linear recurrence relation is:
        - f(i) = c1 * f(i-1) + c2 * f(i-2) + ... + cK * f(i-K)
      - You can construct T such that its last row is a vector [c1, c2, ..., cK], and for the other rows, the ith row is a zero vector except that its (i+1)th element is 1.

      - **Example:**
        - For the Fibonacci sequence, with f(i) = f(i-1) + f(i-2), the transformation matrix T might look like this:
          ```
          T = | 0  1 |
              | 1  1 |
          ```

   d. **Determine FN:**
      - After constructing the transformation matrix, the rest is straightforward. Obtain Fi for any i by repeatedly multiplying T with F1. In general:
        - Fi = T^(i-1) * F1
      - Therefore, the original problem is now (almost) solved: compute FN as above, and then f(N) is exactly the first row of FN.

   e. **Efficient Implementation:**
      - The article provides a C++ code implementing the solution, using matrix multiplication and exponentiation by squaring for efficiency.
